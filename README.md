Attributes include state, district, crop, season, year, area, and production

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Power BI
DAX for calculated measures
Data cleaning, modeling, and visualization

📈 Key Metrics

Total Production
Average Production
Crop Efficiency
Crop Diversity Index
Top Producing State
Top Crop

🔍 Analysis Performed

Crop production analysis by state, district, crop type, season, and year
Seasonal analysis across Kharif, Rabi, Summer, Winter, and Whole Year
Productivity analysis using area vs production
Geographic analysis using map visualizations

💡 Key Insights

Identification of top-producing states and crops
Seasonal patterns influencing production volumes
Variation in productivity and crop diversity across regions

🚀 Outcome

The dashboard enables users to explore agricultural production trends, compare regional performance, and gain actionable insights through interactive filters, maps, and multi-page reports.
